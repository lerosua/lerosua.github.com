<p>i have a long time no visit here. Thoese days i try another blog in<br />hi.baidu.com.  But it is a terrible experience for me. The first , it no allow<br />the word which like tibet, freedom present in a article. i know this is<br />all chinese BSP does.  so , i try to convert my word in a picture. but it<br />also delete my picture too.<br />they do this without ask me. event no a notice .<br />how they think the customer what is for them?<br />i so hate they attention. so i left again.<br />evnt my blog have no one read in china. i don't want to write in thoese<br />BSP again.  this is my furious.<br />maybe i can't blame they. because they also have reason, all for this because<br />is in china. So, no oddness in everything.</p>
