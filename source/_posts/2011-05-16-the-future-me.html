<p>When i was young, and in the college. I alway thinking about future. But alway became confusion.I am eagering for someone can talking to me , about his experience, his remorse, his ideality.  But there is no guy do this.</p>

<p>And many year later. when i meet the young man in college.  I became a jabber-jabber. I tell him what need to do in college, i tell him no leave the reget for himself. do what want to do.  Don't fear the future, it is will come anywhere. just live today good. when i finish my talk. I saw the scorn all over him face. no, it is no his face. it is my face. then, i rember maybe has someone talking like this, and i thouht it is bull shit.</p>

<p>i know what it is now. A young man , include me, can't listen the idea against the older. Even the future me talk to young me.</p>
